# Openfed D8

OpenFed is a general-purpose, multilingual Drupal 8 distribution.

It is developed by/for the Belgian Federal Public Service for ICT (Fedict) as
part of the Fast2Web offering.


## Installation

The recommended way to install Openfed is using
[Composer](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#installation-linux-unix-osx).

You can use our [Openfed Project](https://github.com/openfed/openfed8-project/tree/8.x) template like:
